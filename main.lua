--[[

This is the main.lua file. It executes first and, in this demo,
its sole purpose is to set some initial visual settings.

Then, you execute the game or menu scene via Composer.
Composer is the official scene (screen) creation and management
library in Corona; it provides developers with an
easy way to create and transition between individual scenes.

See the Composer Library guide for details:
https://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/system/composer/index.html

-- Include the Composer library
local composer = require( "composer" )
-- for global varaibles
local globalData = require( "globalData" )

-- Removes status bar on iOS
-- https://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/display/setStatusBar.html
display.setStatusBar( display.HiddenStatusBar ) 

-- Removes bottom bar on Android 
if system.getInfo( "androidApiLevel" ) and system.getInfo( "androidApiLevel" ) < 19 then
	native.setProperty( "androidSystemUiVisibility", "lowProfile" )
else
	-- getting a warning here, not sure why
	-- native.setProperty( "androidSystemUiVisibility", "immersiveSticky" ) 
end


-- reserve music channel
audio.reserveChannels(1)

-- global height variable
--globalData.heroYPosition = 0

-- go to menu screen
composer.gotoScene( "scene.mainMenuScene", { params={ } } )

-- Or, instead of the line above, you can cheat skip to a specific level by using the
-- following line, passing to it the JSON file of the level you want to jump to
-- composer.gotoScene( "scene.game", { params={ map="scene/game/map/sandbox2.json" } } )
